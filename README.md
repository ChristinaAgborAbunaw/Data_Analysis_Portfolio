**1. Covid-19 Data Exploration**

**Goal:**

To analyze the global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic by exploring trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The objective was to uncover patterns in the data that could 
inform public health strategies and responses.

**Description:**

This project involved an in-depth exploration of Covid-19 data, covering cases, deaths, and vaccination records from various countries during the years 2020-2021.
The analysis included data loading, data cleaning, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). Using advanced SQL techniques, the project focused on identifying
key trends and comparing the impact of Covid-19 across different regions. Techniques such as joins, common table expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, and window functions
were used to efficiently manage and analyze large datasets.

**Technology:**

SQL Server

**Skills:**

Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types.

**Results:**
The analysis revealed significant trends, such as the correlation between vaccination rates and the reduction in new cases and deaths. The project also highlighted countries with
higher death rates relative to cases, providing insights into areas that required more focused public health interventions. By creating views and temporary tables, the data was
organized in a way that made it easier to generate reports and visualize the findings, contributing to data-driven decision-making during the pandemic.
